# TPICAP AI Hackathon: Personalized RAG Course Recommender

A command-line Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that recommends courses based on user questions and remembers each user's feedback to improve recommendations over time.

---

## Features

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Finds relevant courses from a CSV using semantic search.
- Personalized Recommendations: Remembers user likes/feedback and boosts their favorite courses in future recommendations.
- Memory System: Stores and adapts to user feedback across sessions.
- Runs Locally: All data and logic run on your machine using local LLMs (Ollama).
